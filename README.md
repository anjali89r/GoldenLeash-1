Website dev

//Those from Udacity Google Scholars here are the files I created, feel free to pull and we can decide what parts everyone would like to work on.
This is mainly a website with Html, and css/ SASS files, which ever your more comfortable with. 
Once we have a layout with content I can make it mobile compatible via bootstrap. 
This will be a fun learning experience building and colaborating :)
